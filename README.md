# Assignment 2: Usability Testing with Users

## Site Tested
For the purpose of this usability testing (UT), we have used the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/) website. Their website allows users to explore various resources like videos and articles related to our environement and provides initiatives users can take to ameliorate the pressing issues that can damage our future. Moreover, they provide specific environmental goals they are working towards achieving.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability testing (UT) allows us to gain an understanding of the interaction between users and products, which is significant to developing a product. Therefore, the goal of this usability testing was to test the difficulty, efficiency, and satisfaction of the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/) website. Because this website is rich in resources, users may potentially feel overwhelmed when scouring through and there is a chance that they might even miss several information. This should not be the case as there is a variety of users who may want to gain more insight about our environment and potentially help make a change. Therefore, the goal was to see how the user obtained specific information when instructed to do so.

## The Process and Materials 
The UT took place remotely via Zoom in the dorms of University of California, Los Angeles. The user utilized a Macbook while I utilized a Windows pc laptop and both were equipped with a webcam and a microphone. We utilized Zoom's sharing screen option that allowed me (the moderator) to view the users screen that displayed the google form survey on half of the screen and the website on the other.  

As the moderator, I was responsible for guiding the user through each part of the online survey. The survey consisted of nine phases: an introduction phase, obtaining informed consent from the user, instructing users to answer background questions, pre-test questionnaire phase, observing how users accomplish the three tasks and scenarios given, post-test questionnaire phase, completing the system usability scale, completing the production satisfaction card, and answering questions relating to their demographics.

## Findings and Reflection
This usability testing allowed me to understand that while the UNEP website has a lot of resources, it isn't complex to utilize than expected. Additionally, although the user did find difficulty in accomplishing the first task, they were able to accomplish the two others well. This informed me that I should try to restructure the tasks and scenarios or come up with new ones that can test different features. The only interruption we had was bad internet connection, but otherwise all went smoothly. I felt that this was a good rehearsal for the real usability testing. I kept my confidence and positivity. Next time I would prepare a timer so that I have an idea of how fast/slow we are completing this task and so that I can make a better judgement on whether it would be right for me to give them hints or allow more time to complete a task.
