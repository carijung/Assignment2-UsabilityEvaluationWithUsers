## Site Tested
For the purpose of this usability testing, we have used the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/) website. Their website allows users to explore various resources like videos and articles related to our environement and provides initiatives users can take to ameliorate the pressing issues that can damage our future. Moreover, they provide specific environmental goals they are working towards achieving.

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability testing allows us to gain an understanding of the interaction between users and products, which is significant to developing a product. Therefore, the goal of this usability testing was to test the difficulty, efficiency, and satisfaction of the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/) website. Because this website is rich in resources, users may potentially feel overwhelmed when scouring through and there is a chance that they might even miss several information. This should not be the case as there is a variety of users who may want to gain more insight about our environment and potentially help make a change. Therefore, the goal was to see how the user obtained specific information when instructed to do so.
